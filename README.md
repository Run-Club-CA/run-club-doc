### Purpose

A New South Wales running and sports shoe store has a local running club located in Waverley, that has for the most part been organized by using facebook.  
The owners of the store feel that although their group on facebook has been useful, its also created some challenges such as updating and cancelling events due to unforeseen circumstances, having a more easier to understand calender, and not being as user friendly as they would like.  

The purpose of the Run club application is to address these issues and create a user friendly, community driven and welcoming place. The application will allow regular users to view upcoming events, keep track of any changes to events and track their own progress with how many kms have been run from completed events. Where the app will also benefit the trainers by giving them better autonomy with scheduling their events, as well as being able to update or cancel events with ease and check off completed runs for attendees.  

The running club is looking to create an app that promotes a healthier lifestyle, is community focused and inclusive.
